# AI Driven Customer Churn Forecasting

## Overview

This project enhances customer churn prediction by combining C5 decision tree and neural network models for improved accuracy.

## Motivation

Accurate churn forecasting helps businesses develop effective retention strategies, crucial for maintaining growth and profitability.

## Tools and Libraries

- Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- C5.0 Decision Tree Algorithm, Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- scikit-learn, StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder, ColumnTransformer

## Setup

### Running on Kaggle

1. **Upload the Project Files**:
    - Go to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
    - Create a new notebook.
    - Upload the necessary project files (`ai-driven-customer-churn-forcasting.ipynb, dataset CSV, etc.).


2. **Dataset**:
    - Ensure the dataset is uploaded to Kaggle or available via Kaggle Datasets.
    - Modify the script to load the dataset correctly from Kaggleâ€™s environment, if necessary.


## Implementation

1. **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. **Model Building**:
   - Train C5 decision tree and neural network models.
   - Combine their predictions for a final hybrid model.
3. **Evaluation**: Use confusion matrices and accuracy comparisons to evaluate model performance.

## Results

- **Improved Accuracy**: The hybrid model shows better accuracy than individual models.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Highlights model performance in classifying churn vs. non-churn.

## Conclusion

The hybrid model effectively combines decision tree and neural network strengths, providing better churn predictions. Limitations include data quality, model complexity, and generalizability across different datasets.
